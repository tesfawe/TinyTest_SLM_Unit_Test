However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.\nTribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:\ntri(1) = 3\ntri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.\ntri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.\nFor example:\ntri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2\ntri(4) = 3\ntri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)\n       = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \nYou are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the \nfirst n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\nExamples:\ntri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]",
